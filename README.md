# open-font-collections
Description:
This repo contains a variety of high quality Open License fonts, sorted into convenient collections, and accompanied by a font "menu", which is just a file that demonstrates the font set by using it in a graphical story-like situation.

Font requirements:
1. All fonts included must be under a license that permits free coppying and distribution, as well as allow editing, and extending.
2. Fonts must be professional looking, with proper kerning between characters
3. Fonts must have license information accompanying them

Quirks and conventions:
1. Visual aesthetic comes first. I don't care if a font has 23 language glyphs included in it, if it's ugly as hell, it does not belong in this repo. All fonts should include a complete english set *at least*.
2. With Quirk (1) in mind, we concentrate on extending current attractive font sets to include as many extended language glyphs and font weights as possible. This is one of the main reasons for the existence of this repo. That is, I'm putting up the pretty ones I use regularly in my professional work for extending, collecting, sharing, and eventual distribution as standard sets in FLOSS projects.
3. There will be some overlap. A font can go equally well in a variety of different graphical situations, and it's important to include them in all applicable sets.
